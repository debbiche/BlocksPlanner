## Webserver

To start the web server:

1. Install ruby >=1.9.3 (Windows users can Google `ruby installer` for an easy to use installation tool)
2. Install bundler (a ruby package manager): `[sudo] gem install bundler`
3. Install dependencies by running `bundle install`
4. Start the webserver by running `ruby server.rb` 
5. See console output for the server url 

Notes:

Many version of Mac OS X come with ruby preinstalled.
This is typically an old version: 1.8.7.
For "serious" ruby use, you will want to use some kind of ruby environment manager, for example RVM or rubyenv or chruby.
